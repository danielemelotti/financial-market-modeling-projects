# Description
This repository contains 5 projects dedicated to exploring relevant model types within the field of Advanced Financial Market Modeling. All the analyses were developed using the **OxMetrics** software. Below, see a brief description for each project.

## 1. DAX-BUS Stylized Facts
This project examines daily data from the DAX and BUX indices for the period 2002-2020, analyzing their logarithmic returns. It identifies volatility clusters during major economic events like the early 2000s recessions, the 2008 financial crisis, the European sovereign debt crisis, and the COVID-19 outbreak. The study includes autocorrelation analysis, distribution analysis revealing non-normality with excess kurtosis and skewness, and various statistical tests including normality, ARCH, Box-Pierce, ADF tests, and more. Results were similar for both indixes' returns, presenting significant ARCH effects, non-normal distributions, autocorrelation in squared residuals, and stationarity of returns, with slight differences between DAX and BUX in terms of runs test and autocorrelation in standardized residuals.

## 2. Time-varying Beta
This project provides an extensive analysis on the time-varying Beta of Ferrari N.V. (RACE) stock, using daily data from the NYSE Composite Index over a five-year period. It details the process of estimating Beta, highlighting the stock's higher volatility compared to the NYSE Composite. The study incorporates various statistical tests, GARCH models, and concludes with Beta estimation, showing that RACE's Beta often exceeds 1, indicating higher volatility than the market. The analysis also reveals that Beta's value is not stable, demonstrating significant fluctuations in volatility relative to the market.

## 3. ARFIMA Specifications for UK Inflation
This project explores various Autoregressive Fractionally Integrated Moving Average (ARFIMA) specifications to model UK inflation from Q1 1965 to Q3 2019, assessing their performance through statistical tests and information criteria like AIC and SC. It includes detailed model specifications, statistical significance of parameters, and model comparisons based on log-likelihood and information criteria, concluding with the identification of the most suitable model for analyzing UK inflation data over the specified period. The best specification is an ARMA(0, 4) with MA(2) fixed, without constant and seasonality variables, and with two dummy variables. Interestingly, the best model in terms of forecasting accuracy is another model, which shows not good diagnostics. This shows that sometimes a model is which is not so suitable in terms of diagnostics could produce the better forecasts than models which are better constructed.

## 4. Jump Detection in the Daily and Intraday Returns of PZU
This project analyzes the stock of PZU, the largest insurance company in Poland. It does so by using 10-minute frequency data to identify jumps in returns. It employs the Barndorff-Nielsen and Shepard (BNS) approach and the Lee and Mykland approach for detecting jumps. The BNS method detected 21 jumps in 61 days of data, showing a significant proportion of days with jumps. The Lee and Mykland method, focusing on intraday data, identified 24 jumps. The project highlights the variation in jump detection between the two methods, providing insights into volatility and jump dynamics within the financial markets.

## 5. SARIMA and UCM applied on Unemployment Rate in Italy
The project analyzes the unemployment rate in Italy from 1995 to 2020 using SARIMA (Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) and UCM (Unobserved Components Model) approaches. It highlights the seasonality and trends within the unemployment rates, providing detailed statistical analyses, model comparisons, and forecasts. The project aims to identify the most accurate models for predicting future unemployment rates, considering various statistical measures and diagnostics to assess model performance.
